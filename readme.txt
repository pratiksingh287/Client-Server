Open the Folder in Eclipse2. Run The java files in the order3. Server.java4. Client.java5. GUIServer.java6. GUIClient.java (Run it multiple times for multiple clients)7. You’ll see multiple gui. Opening for server and clients8. Start the server (Press start) and connect the client on the similar port number.(Press      the login button)9. Now you can communicate and see who all are connected using ‘whoisin’ button10. It has a timer for each client which is incremented randomly.
11. To Update the timer across the clients, just click on the update button and it will send the message across the other clients.
12.  To disconnect the client press the logout button or to stop the server press stop      
**** [p.s if the server doesn’t starts, try changing the port number]****REFERENCES:-1. Github.com2. eTutorials.org3. stackoverflow.com4. allanswered.com5. Stackexchange.com
